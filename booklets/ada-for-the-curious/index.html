    <p>This booklet is for developers who are curious about Ada.</p>
<p>Contrary to some ü¶ï associations you might have, Ada is a modern language,
with modules, a strong type system, and easy-to-use concurrency.
It&rsquo;s blazing fast, backed by a cool community, and it&rsquo;s easy to learn.</p>
<p>Instead of giving an extensive introduction to everything you can easily look up yourself,
I want to highlight some of the aspects that make Ada worth looking into.</p>
<p>Consider it a teaser that gets you to know Ada enough to decide whether you like it or not,
and provides pointers where to explore further.</p>
<h1 id="meet-ada">Meet Ada</h1>
<p>Ada was designed specifically for safety-critical software, and this has shaped who Ada is.
Especially in two ways.</p>
<p><strong>Ada enables you to express your intent clearly and unambiguously - both towards the compiler and towards your fellow humans.</strong></p>
<p>Many people find Ada very easy to read, and that&rsquo;s because it tries hard to be.
Of course you can still write obscure code, but Ada does a pretty good job to meet you half way.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a countdown:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Countdown is
begin
   for I in reverse 1 .. 10 loop
      Put_Line (Integer'Image (I));
   end loop;

   Put_Line (&quot;Lift off! üöÄ&quot;);
end Countdown;
</code></pre><p>Ada might look slighlty archane if you grew up with C-family languages,
because it looks like Pascal.
(More on this below, in <a href="#wirths-legacy">Wirth&rsquo;s legacy</a>.)
Don&rsquo;t be deceived by this.</p>
<p><strong>Ada wants to make it hard for you to make errors.</strong></p>
<p>When C feels like walking through a mine field, Ada feels like having extra safety nets everywhere.</p>
<p>It does this in a lot of small things. For example, you cannot re-assign loop variables,
a case statement must contain a case for each value, and you don&rsquo;t fall through to the next one.</p>
<p>And it does this in bigger things, most notably in its strong type system
and all the compile- and run-time checks you can include.
More on both below.</p>
<p>As a result, Ada is not ideal for fast prototyping or for dynamic meta-programming.
Ada was designed for code that absolutely has to work. So it was made to allow you to write well-designed,
solid code, that you can still read when coming back to it after a year.
That&rsquo;s where Ada shines.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you cannot use it for hobby projects or during Advent of Code.
If you prefer designing over debugging, I bet you will enjoy Ada.</p>
<h2 id="wirths-legacy">Wirth&rsquo;s legacy</h2>
<p>Ada is a classical procedural language with a syntax based on Pascal.</p>
<p>TODO History</p>
<p>building blocks</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>declare
   -- local declarations (visible within this unit but nowhere else)
   -- can include constants, variables,functions, procedures
   -- note that declared variables are not initialized by default
begin
   -- sequence of statements or nested blocks
exception
   -- handling exceptions
end;
</code></pre><p>There is <a href="https://inf.ethz.ch/news-and-events/spotlights/infk-news-channel/2021/11/niklaus-wirth-video-interview.html">a very nice interview</a>
with Niklaus Wirth (the Swiss computer scientist who invented Pascal),
where he remembers that during his time, all existing programming languages were unneccessarily complex.
He wanted to design a language that is as simple as possible, of course without losing power.</p>
<p>In Ada, you see some of this legacy.
For example, you define an exception like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Timestamp_Is_In_The_Past : exception;
</code></pre><p>You raise it like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>raise Timestamp_Is_In_The_Past;
</code></pre><p>Or, if you want to include more information, like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>raise Timestamp_Is_In_The_Past with &quot;Input timestamp cannot be in the past&quot;;
</code></pre><p>That&rsquo;s it. For basic exceptions, this is arguably all you need.</p>
<h2 id="the-community">The community</h2>
<p>That Ada is alive and kicking is most obvious when you get to know the community.
It&rsquo;s admittedly one of the smallest but also one of the friendliest and most welcoming
programming language communities I have come across.</p>
<p><strong>Forum:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discord:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reddit:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Monthly Meetup:</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-road-to-ada">The road to Ada</h2>
<p>The Ada ecosystem can be a bit confusing in the beginning.
But the core is simple:
Ada is a free language. It&rsquo;s an ISO standard and not owned by any company.</p>
<p>There are free and proprietary compilers.
The one you will come across first and most often is called <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GNAT">GNAT</a>,
a free Ada compiler integrated into GCC.</p>
<p>AdaCore is a driving force behind many current developments in Ada.
They have <a href="https://learn.adacore.com/">a collection of excellent tutorials</a> for people from different perspectives,
which allow you to play with Ada directly in the browser.
I highly recommend them as starting point.</p>
<p>The next great entry point, when you want to build and run Ada on your own machine,
is <a href="https://ada-lang.io/">ada-lang.io</a>.
It provides not only resources but also the package manager Alire,
built by the community exactly for people like you.
Starting can be as easy as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download Alire.</li>
<li>Select the default toolchain.</li>
<li>Create a new repository.</li>
<li>Build and run it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I provide a project template below in <a href="enough-ada-to-do-advanet-of-code">Enough Ada to do Advent of Code</a>.</p>
<p>Once you want to know the language in more depth, there is no way around
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009181358">Programming in Ada 2012</a> by John Barnes,
and the <a href="http://ada-auth.org/standards/22rm/html/RM-TOC.html">Ada Reference Manual (ARM)</a>
(or a <a href="https://ada-lang.io/docs/arm/">prettier version of it</a>).
Both are very extensive and quite accessible,
but feel free to not worry about them in the beginning - even though people will probably point you
to both if you ask for pointers.</p>
<p>If you want to explore the rest of the iceberg, <a href="https://github.com/ohenley/awesome-ada">Awesome Ada</a>
provides a pretty comprehensive list of resources.</p>
<h2 id="ada-code-worth-reading">Ada code worth reading</h2>
<p>Ada is an industrial language used in aerospace, defence, rails, medicine, and a couple of other fields.
So most Ada code - especially most well-written, fire-proven Ada code - is not on GitHub.
(That&rsquo;s also why Ada doesn&rsquo;t show up in the TIOBE index.)</p>
<p>Still, here are a few repositories worth exploring if you want to get a feeling
for bigger Ada projects.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<h1 id="sneak-peaks">Sneak peaks</h1>
<h2 id="separation-of-specification-and-body">Separation of specification and body</h2>
<p>and how this blends design and implementation</p>
<h2 id="imagine-there-is-an-integer-type-and-nobody-is-using-it">Imagine there is an integer type and nobody is using it</h2>
<p>Ada offers a few safety nets. One of the nicest is baked into the type system; Richard Riehle calls it precision datatypes.</p>
<p>First, you can derive one type from another. Both types are different, and you will never be able to mix them.
For example, if you define:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>ùöùùö¢ùöôùöé‚ÄÇùôøùöòùöûùöóùöç_ùöÇùöéùöåùöòùöóùöçùöú‚ÄÇùöíùöú‚ÄÇùöóùöéùö†‚ÄÇùôµùöïùöòùöäùöù;
ùöùùö¢ùöôùöé‚ÄÇùôΩùöéùö†ùöùùöòùöó_ùöÇùöéùöåùöòùöóùöçùöú‚ÄÇùöíùöú‚ÄÇùöóùöéùö†‚ÄÇùôµùöïùöòùöäùöù;
</code></pre><p>Then providing <code>Pound_Seconds</code> when a function expects <code>Newton_Seconds</code>, or taking the sum of both, will not work. You need to explicitely convert one into the other. (I&rsquo;m sure <a href="">the Mars Climate Orbiter</a> would have liked this.)</p>
<p>What is even better is that you can define the range that the type should cover.
For example, we can define temperature like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:2;-o-tab-size:2;tab-size:2"><code class="language-ada" data-lang="ada"><span style="color:#111">ùöùùö¢ùöôùöé</span>‚ÄÇ<span style="color:#111">ùöÉùöéùöñùöôùöéùöõùöäùöùùöûùöõùöé_ùô≤</span>‚ÄÇ<span style="color:#111">ùöíùöú</span>‚ÄÇ<span style="color:#111">ùöóùöéùö†</span>‚ÄÇ<span style="color:#111">ùôµùöïùöòùöäùöù</span>‚ÄÇ<span style="color:#111">ùöõùöäùöóùöêùöé</span>‚ÄÇ<span style="color:#f92672">-</span><span style="color:#111">ùü∏ùüΩùüπ</span><span style="color:#111">.</span><span style="color:#111">ùü∑ùüª</span><span style="color:#111">..</span><span style="color:#111">ùüπùü∂ùü∂_ùü∂ùü∂ùü∂_ùü∂ùü∂ùü∂</span><span style="color:#111">.</span><span style="color:#111">ùü∂</span><span style="color:#111">;</span>
<span style="color:#111">ùöùùö¢ùöôùöé</span>‚ÄÇ<span style="color:#111">ùöÉùöéùöñùöôùöéùöõùöäùöùùöûùöõùöé_K</span>‚ÄÇ<span style="color:#111">ùöíùöú</span>‚ÄÇ<span style="color:#111">ùöóùöéùö†</span>‚ÄÇ<span style="color:#111">ùôµùöïùöòùöäùöù</span>‚ÄÇ<span style="color:#111">ùöõùöäùöóùöêùöé</span>‚ÄÇ<span style="color:#ae81ff">0.</span><span style="color:#111">.</span><span style="color:#00a8c8">Float</span><span style="color:#111">&#39;</span><span style="color:#75af00">Last</span><span style="color:#111">;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Anything below -ùü∏ùüΩùüπ.ùü∑ùüª degrees Celcius or 0 Kelvin is not a valid temperature, and it&rsquo;s not something you have to remember to check yourself; Ada checks it for you at compile time and runtime.
(If you are not building a fusion reactor, your accepted range might be much smaller, of course.)</p>
<p>This way of specifying conditions directly in the types allows you to express your intent as clearly and unambiguously as possible.
For example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>type Latitude  is new Float range 0.0 .. 360.0;
type Longitude is new Float range 0.0 .. 360.0;

type Coordinate is record
   Lat  : Latitude;
   Long : Longitude;
end record;
</code></pre><p>Now you have to work hard to mix up latitude and longitude in your code.</p>
<p>This is helpful even if you don&rsquo;t want to restrict the data range.
Consider the neat trick of declaring floating-point types like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code> type Some_Float is new Float range Float'Range;
</code></pre><p>This means your derived type has the same range as <code>Float</code>, but excluding anything that is not in its range: NaN, infinity, or whatever non-numeric values your machine defines. So if your code ends up with something that is not a number, numeric operations raise a constraint error instead of propagating the non-numeric value through your whole program.</p>

<p>It might be hard to let go, but in Ada you don&rsquo;t need pointers.</p>
<p>Seriously.
Almost everything you want to do, you can do without pointers - and usually more safely so.
(<a href="">Jeff would even tell you that you never need them for anything ever.</a>)</p>

<p>You can find some of the companies using Ada when checking <a href="https://www.adacore.com/company/our-customers">the list of customers of AdaCore</a>.
This list is certainly not complete, but the picture is pretty representative.</p>
<p>Companies range from big names, like Thales, Airbus, and the Automotive Team at NVIDIA,
to start-ups you probably never heard of, like <a href="https://www.latencetech.com/">Latence Tech</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Ada jobs are often not heavily advertised. Even if you look at open positions at companies that hire Ada programmers, Ada might be mentioned as a nice-to-have experience, but it‚Äôs almost never in the job title.</p>
<p>One good strategy in addition to looking for jobs is to put yourself out there as Ada developer, writing and talking about Ada, so recruiters can find you.</p>
