    <p>Neutrons have roughly the same mass as a proton, but no charge.</p>
<p>Neutrons have a larger range than charged particles, because they don&rsquo;t interact with the electrons in the atoms of matter, as they have no charge.</p>
<h1 id="free-neutrons">Free neutrons</h1>
<p>Free neutrons are unstable, with a halflife of about 10.4 minutes. They undergo 
<span>
                  
        \(\beta^-\)
    
</span>
 decay, yielding a proton, an electron and an antineutrino:

<span>
     
        $${}^1_0n \to {}^1_1p &#43; {}^{\ \ \,0}_{-1}e &#43; \overline{v}$$
    
</span>
</p>
<h2 id="classification">Classification</h2>
<p>Free neutrons can be classified according to their kinetic energy. They can be roughly divided into three energy ranges:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Thermal neutrons</em> (up to 1 eV) are in a thermal equilibrium with their surrounding, with the most probable energy at 20 degrees C being 0.025 eV (~ 2km/s). They often have a much larger neutron absorption cross-section than fast neutrons.</li>
<li><em>Resonance neutrons</em> (1 eV - 100 keV) have energies where the neutron capture cross-sections peak, and the probability of capture exceeds the probability of fusion.</li>
<li><em>Fast neutrons</em> (1-10 MeV) are produced by nuclear fission. They have a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of energy with a mean energy of 2 MeV in the case of uranium-235 fission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thermal reactors use thermal neutrons to sustain the fission chain reaction. They thus slow down the produced fast neutrons using a neutron moderator, until their energy is in thermal equilibrium with the atoms in the system. <a href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/fast-neutron-reactors.aspx">Fast reactors</a>, on the other hand, use fast neutrons to sustain the fission chain reaction, not using any neutron moderator.</p>
<p>The energy of a neutron has a big impact on its cross-sections. An important property of a reactor core thus is its neutron energy distribution.</p>
<h1 id="neutron-interactions">Neutron interactions</h1>
<p>Since neutrons have no charge, they pass easily through electron clouds and directly interact with nuclei. Those interactions can be thought of as two steps: first the neutron is absorbed by the nucleus, forming a compound nucleus, which then decays.</p>
<p>There are two main kinds of interactions: scattering and absorption.</p>
<p><strong>Elastic scattering</strong> (n,n): The neutron and nucleus are left unchanged, no energy is transferred. That is, Q=0. It can be understood as a collision where the neutron bounces off the nucleus, and is the only interaction that is not considered to form a compound nucleus.</p>
<p><strong>Inelastic scattering</strong> (n,n'): The neutron penetrates the nucleus, forming a compound nucleus in an excited state. This compound nucleus returns to its ground state by gamma decay, emitting a neutron (on a different energy level than the incoming one, so energy was transferred).</p>
<p>In general, scattering refers to nuclear reactions in which the outgoing particle is the same as the incident particle.</p>
<p><strong>Radioactive capture</strong> (n,
<span>
                  
        \(\gamma\)
    
</span>
): The neutron is absorbed by the nucleus, and gamma rays are emitted. Other neutron absorption reactions are (n,
<span>
                  
        \(\alpha\)
    
</span>
) and (n,p), which can be either exothermic or endothermic.</p>
<p><strong>Neutron production</strong> (n,2n) and (n,3n): The nucleus emits one or more neutrons. For example, 
<span>
                  
        \({}^2H\)
    
</span>
 and 
<span>
                  
        \({}^9Be\)
    
</span>
 have loosely bound neutrons that can easily be extracted.</p>
<p><strong>Fission</strong>: The neutron causes the nucleus to split into two fission products, emitting 2 to 4 neutrons and releasing energy.

<span>
     
        $$X \to Y &#43; Z &#43; {}^1_0n$$
    
</span>

This can also happen spontaneously, but its probability is low. (Californium has an exceedingly high probability for spontaneous fission, ~3%, which is why it is sometimes used to jumpstart nuclear reactors).</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> Uranium fission</p>

<span>
     
        $${}^1_0n &#43; {}^{235}_{92}U \,\to\, {}^{236}_{92}U \,\to\, {}^{92}_{36}Kr &#43; {}^{141}_{56}Ba &#43; 2.44{}^1_0n$$
    
</span>

<p>The energy of the resulting neutrons is a probability distribution, with the most likely energy ~700 keV and the average energy ~2 MeV. The are, however, too high-energy to engage in further fission events. In a reactor, they thus need to be slowed down by a moderator like water, where neutrons successively lose energy through elastic scattering.</p>
<h1 id="cross-sections">Cross-sections</h1>
<p>Cross-sections characterize the probability of a neutron interaction, quantified in terms of characteristic target areas (where a larger area means a larger probability of interaction).</p>
<p>The <strong>microscopic cross-section</strong> 
<span>
                  
        \(\sigma\)
    
</span>
 specifies the probability of a particular neutron interaction with a target nucleus. It depends on the target nucleus, the type of reaction, the neutron energy, and the target energy.</p>
<p>The <strong>macroscopic cross-section</strong> 
<span>
                  
        \(\Sigma\)
    
</span>
 specifies this probability of a neutron interaction for the whole medium.
It is considered per unit path length that the neutron travels. The average distance a neutron travels before interacting with a nucleus is its <strong>mean free path</strong> 
<span>
                  
        \(\frac{1}{\Sigma}\)
    
</span>
.</p>
<p>With 
<span>
                  
        \(N\)
    
</span>
 the nuclear density:</p>

<span>
     
        $$\sigma \times N = \Sigma$$
    
</span>


<span>
     
        $$\Sigma \times \text{neutron flux} = \text{reaction rate}$$
    
</span>

<p><strong>Resonance region:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the sum of the kinetic energy of the neutron and the binding energy correspond to an energy level of the compound nucleus, the neutron cross section exhibits a spike in its probability of interaction which are called resonances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Fission cross-section for U-235:</strong></p>
<p><img src="/images/docs/fission-cross-section-u235.png" alt="Fission cross-section for U-235"></p>
<p>Neutrons generated by fission are in the higher energy range, the red circle marks the thermal energy range. U-235 fissions with neutrons at all energy levels (while U-238 requires neutrons of at least 1 MeV), however in the range of 1-100 eV there are also strong resonance regions for neutron capture. So in order to keep a fission chain reaction going with U-235, neutrons need to be slowed down into the thermal region (~0.025 eV), quickly in order to avoid spending too much time in the resonance regions for capture.</p>
<p>In calculation, neutron energy is often simplified by splitting the energy range into two groups (thermal and fast) and taking the average in each group.</p>
