    <p>Nuclear reactions are reactions where nuclear particles interact; comprising decay processes as well as collision reactions like fission and fusion.</p>
<p><strong>Notation:</strong> 
<span>
                  
        \(a &#43; A \to B &#43; b\)
    
</span>
 or 
<span>
                  
        \(A(a,b)B\)
    
</span>
</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>
                  
        \(a\)
    
</span>
 the projectile</li>
<li>
<span>
                  
        \(A, B\)
    
</span>
 nuclei</li>
<li>
<span>
                  
        \(b\)
    
</span>
 the ejectile(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>Nuclear reactions conserve:</p>
<ul>
<li>mass (number of nucleons)</li>
<li>energy</li>
<li>charge</li>
<li>momentum</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="q-value">Q-value</h1>
<p>The <em>Q-value</em> of a nuclear reaction is the amount of mass that is turned into energy per decay, i.e. the difference between the sum of the masses of the initial reactants and the sum of the masses of the final products.</p>
<p>For example, for 
<span>
                  
        \(\)
    
</span>
:</p>

<span>
     
        $$Q=((m_a &#43; m_A) - (m_b &#43; m_B))\,c^2$$
    
</span>

<p>Or, when using the conversion factor (cf. <a href="/docs/energy">mass-energy equivalence</a>):</p>

<span>
     
        $$Q=((m_a &#43; m_A) - (m_b &#43; m_B))\,931.49\,\text{MeV}$$
    
</span>

<p>
<span>
                  
        \(m\)
    
</span>
 can be both the mass of the nuclei and the mass of the neutral atoms (be aware which one, because it does make a difference).</p>
<p>When 
<span>
                  
        \(Q\)
    
</span>
 is positive, there is a net increase in the energy of the particles; the reaction is <strong>exothermic</strong> (mass was converted into kinetic energy).</p>
<p>When 
<span>
                  
        \(Q\)
    
</span>
 is negative, there is a net decrease in energy; the reaction is <strong>endothermic</strong> (kinetic energy was converted into mass).</p>
<p>
<span>
                  
        \(Q\)
    
</span>
 can also be defined in terms of binding energy 
<span>
                  
        \(BE\)
    
</span>
, as: 
<span>
                  
        \(Q=(BE_B &#43; BE_Bb) - (BE_A &#43; BE_a)\)
    
</span>

So if the binding energy of the product nuclei is larger than that of the initial nucleus, i.e. when the reaction produces a more stable configuration, energy is released.</p>
<h1 id="decay">Decay</h1>
<p><em>Emitted particles are referred to by their Greek letters when they come from the nucleus.</em></p>
<h2 id="alpha-decay">Alpha decay</h2>

<span>
     
        $${}^A_Z X \to {}^{A-4}_{Z-2} Y^{(-2)} &#43; {}^4_2He^{(&#43;2)}$$
    
</span>

<p>A relatively heavy atom emits an alpha particle, in order to get to a more stable state. Alpha particles are Helium nuclei 
<span>
                  
        \({}^4_2He^{2&#43;}\)
    
</span>
, i.e. Helium atoms stripped off their electrons. The positive charge of 
<span>
                  
        \(&#43;2\)
    
</span>
, in fact, doesn&rsquo;t last long, as alpha particles are very quick to grab two electrons; likewise 
<span>
                  
        \(Y\)
    
</span>
has a negative charge of 
<span>
                  
        \(-2\)
    
</span>
 but very quickly loses the two excess electrons.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
<img src="/images/docs/decay_alpha.png" alt="Alpha decay">
(The y-axis is released energy, the x-axis is atomic number Z. Arrow to the left means decreasing the number of protons.)</p>
<h2 id="beta-decay">Beta decay</h2>
<p>Beta decay comes in two flavors, with beta particles being electrons and positrons from the nucleus.</p>
<h2 id="beta-minus-hahahugoshortcode-s19-hbhb-decay">Beta minus (
<span>
                  
        \(\beta^-\)
    
</span>
) decay</h2>
<p>A neutron splits into a proton and an electron as well as an antineutrino.

<span>
     
        $${}^A_Z X \to {}^{\ \ \ \ A}_{Z&#43;1} Y^{(&#43;)} &#43; {}^{\ \ \,0}_{-1}e &#43; \overline{v}$$
    
</span>
</p>
<p>The resulting atom 
<span>
                  
        \(Y\)
    
</span>
has a positive charge but is very quick in capturing an electron to become neutral again.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><img src="/images/docs/decay_betaminus_b12.png" alt="Beta minus decay">
<img src="/images/docs/decay_betaminus_c14.png" alt="Beta minus decay"></p>
<p>(Arrow to the right means increase of protons.)</p>
<h2 id="beta-plus-hahahugoshortcode-s22-hbhb-decay">Beta plus (
<span>
                  
        \(\beta^&#43;\)
    
</span>
) decay</h2>
<p>A proton is transformed into a neutron, and a positron and a neutrino are emitted.

<span>
     
        $${}^A_Z X \to {}^{\ \ \ \ A}_{Z-1} Y^{(-)} &#43; {}^0_1e &#43; v$$
    
</span>
</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong> (EC = electron capture):
<img src="/images/docs/decay_betaplus.png" alt="Beta plus decay"></p>
<h2 id="gamma-decay">Gamma decay</h2>
<p>Reconfiguration of an atom to go from an excited state to a ground state. The nucleus is not changing, it just loses energy but emitting high energy gamma rays 
<span>
                  
        \({}^0_0\gamma\)
    
</span>
. These high wave-length electromagnetic waves are <em>photons</em>, particles with zero rest mass and charge, traveling at the speed of light.</p>
<p>Usually, the de-excitement happens in an unmeasurable short time after the excited state was formed. When it is delayed, the longer-lived excited states are called <em>isomeric states</em>, and decays from these states are called <em>isomeric transitions</em> (IT).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
<img src="/images/docs/decay_gamma.png" alt="Gamma decay">
(Atom number does not change, thus line is straight down.)</p>
<p>IT competes with with <em>internal conversion</em> (IC), which can be thought of the gamma ray hitting an electron on the way out of the nucleus, leading to the gamma ray to be absorbed and the electron to be emitted from the atom. Subsequently, an outer electron will fill the resulting hole, emitting an x-ray (which could also hit an electron on the way out; the thus emitted electron is called Auger electron).</p>
<h2 id="decay-rate-and-decay-probability">Decay rate and decay probability</h2>
<p>The decay rate of nuclei is specified as:</p>

<span>
     
        $$\frac{dN}{dt}=-\lambda N$$
    
</span>

<p>Where 
<span>
                  
        \(N\)
    
</span>
 is the number of nuclei present, and 
<span>
                  
        \(\lambda\)
    
</span>
 is the decay constant for the element. If nuclides are also produced at a constant rate 
<span>
                  
        \(R\)
    
</span>
, the right-hand side changes to 
<span>
                  
        \(-\lambda N &#43; R\)
    
</span>
.</p>
<p>The analytical solution to this differential equation is:</p>

<span>
     
        $$N(t)=N(0)\,e^{-\lambda t}$$
    
</span>

<p>Where 
<span>
                  
        \(N(t)\)
    
</span>
 is the number of nuclei still present at time 
<span>
                  
        \(t\)
    
</span>
, and 
<span>
                  
        \(N(0)\)
    
</span>
 is the initial number of nuclei. Or, in the case of simultaneous constant production:</p>

<span>
     
        $$N(t)=N(0)\,e^{-\lambda (t)} &#43; \frac{R}{\lambda}(1-e^{-\lambda (t)})$$
    
</span>

<p>
<span>
                  
        \(\frac{N(t)}{N(0)}\)
    
</span>
 is the ratio of nuclei surviving until time 
<span>
                  
        \(t\)
    
</span>
. This can be seen as the probability of one nucleus to survive up to 
<span>
                  
        \(t\)
    
</span>
, so 
<span>
                  
        \(1-\frac{N(t)}{N(0)}\)
    
</span>
 corresponds to the probability of the nucleus decaying until 
<span>
                  
        \(t\)
    
</span>
. With 
<span>
                  
        \(\frac{N(t)}{N(0)}=e^{-\lambda t}\)
    
</span>
&rdquo;, this gives the following probability of a nucleus to have decayed after time 
<span>
                  
        \(t\)
    
</span>
:</p>

<span>
     
        $$p = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}$$
    
</span>

<p>(For infinitesimal 
<span>
                  
        \(t\)
    
</span>
 this can be approximated as 
<span>
                  
        \(\lambda t\)
    
</span>
.)</p>
<p>This matches the intuition that the probability of decaying until one half-life is 0.5, the probability of decaying until two half-lives is 0.75 (0.5 + 0.5*0.5, or: the conditional probability of decaying within one half-life plus the conditional probability of decaying within the second half-life given it survived the first half-life), and the probability of decaying within a very large number of half-lives approaches 1.</p>
<p>The decay constant is related to the half-life 
<span>
                  
        \(T\)
    
</span>
 as follows (which we arrive at when setting 
<span>
                  
        \(N=\frac{1}{2}N(0)\)
    
</span>
&rdquo;):</p>
<p>
<span>
     
        $$\lambda = \cfrac{\text{ln}\,2}{T}$$
    
</span>
and 
<span>
                  
        \(T = \cfrac{\text{ln}\,2}{\lambda}\)
    
</span>
</p>
<p>The average life expectancy (or <em>mean life</em>) of a nucleus is 
<span>
                  
        \(\frac{1}{\lambda}\)
    
</span>

<h2 id="radioactive-dating">Radioactive dating</h2>
<p>Solving the decay equation for 
<span>
                  
        \(t\)
    
</span>
 allows for radioactive dating, e.g. where 
<span>
                  
        \(N(t)\)
    
</span>
 is the current amount of carbon-14 present in the sample, 
<span>
                  
        \(N(0)\)
    
</span>
 is the amount of carbon-14 in living tissue, and the half life of carbon-14 is 5700 years.</p>
